Goal:
I will build a site that allows users to navigate character histories
within the DC Universe. They can see what media appearances characters have,
the different biographies from different eras and earths,
just collecting information that offers all the information a DC fan
would need right at their fingertips in one platform.

The site will offer users to either enter a query
OR select from different categories

data/APIs

I will need to collect data from different sources as DC does not have an API.

CHARACTERS - I will build a local database to store all characters: 
  SUPERHEROS:
  To get all superhero characters, using the following site to gather a list of all DC
  superheros
  https://www.superheroapi.com/

  VILLIANS/ANTIHEROS
  There is a github repo containing all DC villians and anti-heros
  https://github.com/thatfiredev/dc-villains-api
  ** 10/25/2022, appears this API is not only just NOT working, but has obviously gathered the same info from SuperHero API
  **** attempting to find alternatives, but in the meantime, villians list is not complete

Media Apperances - I will use a variety of resources to collect all the data I will
need to be able to pair comics, movies, tv shows to the proper characters

  COMICS: goodReads https://www.goodreads.com/api; Metron (comic book db) https://metron.cloud/ ; shortboxed https://api.shortboxed.com/ ; google books https://developers.google.com/books ; comic vine https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/
  MOVIES: IMDB https://developer.imdb.com/ ; Rotten Tomatoes https://developer.fandango.com/rotten_tomatoes
    ** TMDB (the movie db), alternative to imdb
  TV SHOWS: IMDB https://developer.imdb.com/ ; Rotten Tomatoes https://developer.fandango.com/rotten_tomatoes;

  ******10/25/2022 Major Interferences: IMDB is apparently owned by Amazon now! Fee is $150,000 for API access,
  goodreads no longer offers public API access; Metron seems to be a viable option, however they have disabled the sign up button,
  just e-mailed admin to see if I can sign up.
Earth/Eras:
 Possibly Wikipedia? https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page , https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/ ;
 possibly webscraping?



MVP 1.0
- populate databases 
- use db data to create character profiles
- allow for queries that will also catch typos and list any with unfinished 
  queries, e.g., "bat" --> batman, batgirl, batwoman, etc.; "green lantern" -->
  john stewart, hal jordan, kyle raynor, etc.
- simple, centered forms, displays, nothing fancy just yet

MVP 2.0
- Have show all option and be able to narrow down results through filters
- have drop down menu to take user to page with only filter they want to see (like characters only, or heros only)
- simple character profile, will have similar stats/details like dossier (see below)

MVP 3.0
- interactive UI/UX
- get real dossier kind of aesthetic

  also see img file for examples
  - also look into dossier examples from JLU animated universe/young justice/mayyybbe liveaction? (not likely)
