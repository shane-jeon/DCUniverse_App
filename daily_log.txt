- I cleaned up the characters table a bit. Included a function so that I can include a character's bio. Used formatting to just pop in the right values in the right spaces (e.g., f'{name}')

- Have been trying to figure out how to use different APIs, especially ones with vague documentation (or perhaps it's just vague to me because I am still new to using REST APIs. Should've paid better attention during lectures but ah well.)

- figured out comicvine API, just stuck in a dilemma about character duplicates....just going to get that JSON file first and figure it out when I can compare the lists.

- Looking into why APIs have request limits.

found solution to why field_list wasn't working in my API calls. it's because the URL format was
wrong, found example in API developer forum. now working on code to collect all character names in a list to iterate through to get character info from API.

I've been using postman to make the API calls for easier access, to test if my methods are working as opposed to using VSCODE saves a lot of time.

also DC id is 4010-10 i think

ok lesson learned (5:54pm)
don't fiddle around with code untill you start troubleshooting from the source. I fiddled around with my loops and conditionals
when turns out the problem was that the URL wasn't being sent in the right format. figured it out by comparing successful
request in console v. code

6:11pm 
used jsonpickle to solved my serialization problem
CODE IS SUCCESSFUL and FUNCTIONING ...HOWEVER....comicvine has an api request limit of 100 per hour...
need to add code so that will trigger 100 requests every hour but thats for another day
