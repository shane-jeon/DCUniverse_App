10/26/2022 Wednesday,

FOr some reason comic vine isn't filtering out publishers...why could that be?
Is it because the name of the publisher is nested within a dictionary?

-api call comes with api_detail_url....going to use that to create a list of attributing resources

- for some reason any API get request made in VSCode keeps returning with 403 but perfectly fine with postman
I think I may just need to parse through the json file downloaded from postman for readable format ugh

- created function in api.py to clean up postman JSON file. works nicely. Future users may have to try both methods

- took a while to figure out character API, what I will need to do is format as follows

f'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/character/4005-{resource_ID}}/?api_key=6028f8ab23892d424a31b9845b1c36ed4f737523&format=json'
--> iterate through all characters

comicvine API is EXTREMELY annoying to work with. Now I'm having trouble getting a field list.....but at least I know I have the main resource I need to populate my db
-starting to think I'm going to have to make many API calls by iterate through existing character list in order to scrape all the data i need ughhhhh

figured out why my response wasn't returning 200, it's because the request required a HEADER, a 
header is one of the parameters you put into the get request. 
need user-agent in header specifically. to get your user-agent go to: 
https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/

if you can't find it ctrl + f " your full user agent string is:"

how to use comic vine part 1
https://josephephillips.com/blog/how-to-use-comic-vine-api-part1


ran into another road block, type error can't serialize into json. used json pickle. 
https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/object+of+type+response+is+not+json+serializable+django

CODE IS SUCCESSFUL and FUNCTIONING ...HOWEVER....comicvine has an api request limit of 100 per hour...
need to add code so that will trigger 100 requests every hour but thats for another day

RAPIDAPI


url = "https://advanced-movie-search.p.rapidapi.com/genre/movie/list"

headers = {
	"X-RapidAPI-Key": "9cac440147mshfad4f28d042e400p18fa5fjsn5fd81cd960d3",
	"X-RapidAPI-Host": "advanced-movie-search.p.rapidapi.com"
}

res = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

movie_genres = res.json()

json_object = json.dumps(movie_genres, indent=4)

with open('movie_genres.json', 'w') as outfile:
  outfile.write(json_object)
print(response.text)


SUPERHERO SEARCH

url = "https://superhero-search.p.rapidapi.com/api/"

querystring = {"hero":"batman"}

headers = {
	"X-RapidAPI-Key": "9cac440147mshfad4f28d042e400p18fa5fjsn5fd81cd960d3",
	"X-RapidAPI-Host": "superhero-search.p.rapidapi.com"
}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, params=querystring)

batman = response.json()
json_object = json.dumps(batman, indent=3)

with open('batman.json', 'w') as outfile:
  outfile.write(json_object)
print(response.text)

How to make a GET request

- instantiate payload dictionary
- get request w/params=payload 
- turn json into python dct, assign to variable
res = requests.get({URL})

res >> <Response [200]>

search_results = res.json()

search_results >> all JSON information in form of python dict.

req = requests.get({URL}, params)
req.url >> will return URL
